- You may want to reference them later

**Step 3: Ask Questions**
- If anything is unclear, contact your broker
- Better to ask now than be surprised later

**Step 4: Acknowledge**
- Check the box: "☑ I have read and understand the building policies"
- You cannot proceed to application without acknowledging

---

### Why This Matters

**For You:**
- Ensures you know the rules before applying
- Prevents surprises (e.g., "I didn't know no dogs allowed!")
- Legal protection (can't claim ignorance later)

**Common Policy Surprises:**
- Pet restrictions (breeds, sizes)
- Subletting not allowed (or very restricted)
- Strict move-in times (weekdays only)
- High financial requirements (3x rent income, etc.)
- Alteration restrictions (must get board approval for any changes)

**Tip:** If building policy is a dealbreaker (e.g., no pets allowed and you have dog), save yourself time and find a different building!

---

## Personal Introduction (Cover Letter)

### What Is This?

The Personal Introduction (also called cover letter or board letter) is your chance to introduce yourself to the building's board in your own words. It's like a cover letter for a job application.

**Why it matters:**
- Board members get to know you beyond the numbers
- Shows your communication skills
- Demonstrates genuine interest in the building
- Can be a tiebreaker for borderline applications

---

**Paragraph 5: Community**

### Sample Cover Letter

```
Dear [Building Name] Board of Directors,

I am writing to introduce myself and express my sincere interest in becoming a resident of [Building Name] at [Address].

I am a software engineer at Google, where I have worked for the past six years. Originally from California, I relocated to New York in 2018 and have been renting in the West Village. My partner and I are now ready to put down roots and purchase our first home together.

We have long admired [Building Name] for its beautiful architecture, excellent location, and strong sense of community. The proximity to [nearby features - park, subway, restaurants] is ideal for our lifestyle. We are particularly drawn to [specific amenity - roof deck, gym, community room] and look forward to becoming active members of the building community.

Financially, we are well-positioned for this purchase. My stable employment and strong income, combined with our substantial savings and conservative approach to debt management, provide us with a solid financial foundation. We are committed to meeting all financial obligations and being responsible co-op shareholders.

We value quiet, respectful living and pride ourselves on being considerate neighbors. We look forward to contributing positively to the [Building Name] community and maintaining the high standards that make this building special.

Thank you for considering our application. We would be honored to join your community and look forward to the opportunity to meet you.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
```

### Tips for a Great Cover Letter

- ✅ Proofread for grammar/spelling

- ✅ Show enthusiasm
- ✅ Mention financial stability
- ✅ Emphasize being good neighbor

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Use generic template (boards can tell)

- ❌ Ramble (> 1,000 words is too much)
- ❌ Mention problems (financial, legal, health)
- ❌ Complain about current living situation
- ❌ Make demands or requests
- ❌ Be overly casual or use slang
- ❌ Include unrelated personal info

**Red Flags to Avoid:**
- Mentioning financial difficulties
- Discussing legal issues
- Talking about plans to renovate extensively (may concern board)
- Being negative about anything
- Inconsistencies with application data

---

### Common Questions

**Q: Is the cover letter required?**
A: It depends on the building. Some require it, others don't. Even if optional, we **strongly recommend** including one - it can make the difference for borderline applications.

**Q: How long should it be?**
A: 300-500 words (approximately 3-5 paragraphs). Max 2,000 characters (about 400 words).

**Q: Can my broker help me write it?**
A: Your broker can review and give feedback, but it should be in your own words. Boards want to hear from YOU.

**Q: What if I'm not a good writer?**
A: That's okay! Be genuine and sincere. Proofread for basic grammar and spelling. Ask a friend to review.

**Q: Should I mention my pet?**
A: Only if building allows pets AND you have a pet. Otherwise, no need to mention.

**Q: What if I have a unique situation?**
A: Address it briefly and positively. Example: "While I'm relocating from abroad and lack U.S. rental history, I have strong international references and substantial financial resources."

---

### Financial

**Q: Why do you need so much financial information?**
A: Buildings want to ensure residents can afford long-term housing costs. Detailed financials show your stability and reduce follow-up questions.

**Q: What if I don't have 2 years of rent in savings?**
A: That's a general guideline, not absolute requirement. Strong income, excellent credit, and good employment history can compensate. Explain your situation in cover letter.

**Q: Do I need to show all my bank accounts?**
A: Yes - show all accounts. The more assets you show, the stronger your application.

**Q: What if I have high debt?**
A: Be honest and disclose it. If your DTI is high, emphasize your strong income and plan to pay down debt. Consider paying down before applying.

**Q: Can I list family money as my assets?**
A: Only if it's in YOUR name (or joint with spouse). Parents' money is not your asset unless gifted to you (and documented).

---

### Documents

**Q: What format should documents be?**
A: PDF is best. JPG and PNG acceptable. Max 20 MB per file.

**Q: Can I use iPhone photos of documents?**

**Q: What if my employer doesn't allow employment verification calls?**
A: Request an employment verification letter from HR and upload it in Documents section.

A: Yes! More income strengthens your application. Add as separate employment record.

---

**Q: Can I apply even if I don't have a pet yet?**
A: Yes, select "no pets" on application. If you want to get a pet later, you'll need board approval.

**Q: Do I need documentation for my service animal?**
A: Yes, please upload official certification or doctor's letter documenting need for service/emotional support animal.
