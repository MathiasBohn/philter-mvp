---

### Real Estate Review Tips

**Navigate to:** Real Estate Holdings

---

Estimated time: 45-60 minutes if you have all documents ready.

Questions? Call/text me anytime: [your phone]

Best,
[Your Name]
```

---

#### Progress Check-Ins

**After 3 days (if not completed):**
```

Just checking in on your [Building] application. I see you've completed [X] out of 11 sections - great progress!

Still needed:
- [List incomplete sections from sidebar]

Can I help with anything? Happy to jump on a call to walk you through any section.

```

---

#### Pre-Submission Review

**When applicant completes application:**
```

Great news - you've completed all sections!

I'm now reviewing everything to ensure it's perfect before submission. I'll have feedback within 24 hours.

If I find any items that need adjustment, I'll send a detailed list. Otherwise, I'll submit directly.

Best,
[Your Name]
```

---

#### Feedback on Issues

```
Hi [Name],

I've reviewed your application - it's looking great overall! A few items need attention before submission:

1. Employment: Please add your supervisor's contact info for [Current Employer]
2. Financial: Please upload your most recent bank statement (current one is 4 months old)
3. Documents: W-2 image is blurry - can you re-scan or photograph in better lighting?

These are quick fixes. Once complete, I'll submit immediately.

Let me know if you have questions!

Best,
[Your Name]
```

---

### Handling Common Questions

**Q: "Why do they need so much financial information?"**
A: "Buildings want to ensure residents can afford rent/mortgage long-term. Detailed financials show your stability and reduce follow-up questions, speeding up your approval."

**Q: "Do I really need to list all my assets?"**
A: "Yes - the more assets you show, the stronger your application. Think of it as showing off your financial strength!"

**Q: "What's a good cover letter?"**
A: "Introduce yourself, explain why you love this building, and show you're financially responsible and a good neighbor. Be genuine and professional. Would you like to see an example?"

**Q: "I don't own real estate - should I leave that section blank?"**
A: "Yes, if you don't own any real estate, you can leave that section empty. No problem - many renters don't own property."

**Q: "Can I submit without the cover letter?"**
A: "Technically yes, but I strongly recommend it. It's your chance to make a personal connection with the board. A good letter can make the difference for borderline applications."

**2. Optimize Financial Presentation**
- Show ALL assets (don't hide accounts)

- Ensure DTI < 40% (ideally < 30%)

**3. Strong Cover Letter**
- Help applicant write compelling, genuine letter

**5. Proactive RFI Management**

- Add notes to explain unusual items
- Be thorough

---

### Time Management

**Efficient workflow:**
1. **Batch review:** Set aside time weekly to QA all pending applications
2. **Use dashboard filters:** "Ready for submission" view
3. **Prioritize:** Oldest > Newest
4. **Set applicant deadlines:** "Please complete by Friday so I can review and submit Monday"
5. **Track in CRM:** Note application status and follow-up dates

**Average time per application:**
- Thorough QA review: 20-30 minutes
- Feedback to applicant: 10 minutes
- Final submission check: 5 minutes
- **Total:** ~45 minutes per application

**ROI:** 45 minutes of QA = fewer RFIs, faster approvals, happier clients, better reviews

---

### Red Flag Management

**If you spot red flags during QA:**

**Minor red flags (address with applicant):**
- Recent job change → Get letter of explanation
- Low liquid assets → Show additional accounts or explain
- High DTI → Pay down debts if possible
- Employment gap → Explain (education, family leave, etc.)

**Major red flags (discuss before submission):**
- DTI > 50% → May not meet building requirements
- Negative net worth → Serious concern
- Recent bankruptcy/foreclosure → Disclose upfront
- Criminal background → Discuss with building first
- Pet policy violation → Request exception or reconsider

**When to decline representing:**
- Application clearly won't meet building's minimum requirements
- Applicant refuses to provide required information
- Potential fraud (fake documents, inconsistent information)

**How to decline gracefully:**
```
"After reviewing your situation, I don't think this particular building is the right fit based on their financial requirements. I'd be happy to recommend other buildings that might be a better match for your profile."
```

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Self-Employed Applicant

**Challenge:** Self-employment income harder to verify than W-2 employment

**Your approach:**
1. **Extra documentation:**
   - Last 2 years tax returns (full return, not just 1040)
   - Schedule C (business income/expenses)
   - 1099s received
   - Business bank statements (3-6 months)
   - CPA letter verifying income
   - Business license/registration

2. **Cover letter:**
   - Help applicant explain business (what they do, how long, stability)
   - Emphasize consistent income and growth

3. **Financial strength:**
   - Self-employed applicants should show higher reserves (3+ years rent recommended)
   - Demonstrate stability (same business 3+ years ideal)

**Pro Tip:** Self-employed applicants are often high net worth. Emphasize assets and business success in presentation.

---

### Scenario 2: Recent Graduate / First-Time Renter

**Challenge:** Limited employment history, limited assets

**Your approach:**
1. **Guarantor consideration:**
   - Many buildings accept parental guarantor
   - Guarantor provides financial backing
   - Include guarantor financials in application

2. **Emphasize strengths:**
   - New job with reputable company
   - Strong starting salary
   - Excellent credit (if applicable)
   - Educational achievement

3. **Cover letter:**
   - Professional career start
   - Commitment to building
   - Responsible tenant history (if any)

**Pro Tip:** Even if not required, suggest guarantor proactively for marginal applications

---

### Scenario 3: High Net Worth, Complex Finances

**Challenge:** Multiple business entities, trusts, investments - complicated to present

**Your approach:**
1. **Simplify presentation:**
   - Create summary sheet (one-pager with all accounts totaled)
   - Organize documents by category (Personal, Business, Trusts, Investments)
   - Add explanatory notes for complex structures

2. **CPA letter:**
   - Request CPA summary letter certifying net worth and income
   - Adds credibility
   - Simplifies admin review

3. **Cover letter:**
   - Don't over-explain complexity
   - Focus on stability and financial strength
   - Mention professional management (CPA, wealth advisor)

---

### Scenario 4: Application with Issues

**Challenge:** Applicant has past credit issues, employment gap, or other concerns

**Your approach:**
1. **Disclose proactively:**
   - Don't hide issues (admin will find them)
   - Include letter of explanation with application
   - Show how issue is resolved/past

2. **Demonstrate recovery:**
   - Credit: Show recent payment history, increasing score
   - Employment: Show current stable employment
   - Financial: Show rebuilding (growing assets, decreasing debts)

3. **Emphasize positives:**
   - Current strong position
   - Lessons learned
   - Responsibility and recovery

**Pro Tip:** Applicants who proactively explain issues and show recovery often get approved. It's the hiding of issues that causes denials.

---

### Scenario 5: Tight Timeline

**Challenge:** Applicant needs approval in < 2 weeks

**Your approach:**
1. **Set realistic expectations:**
   - Explain typical review timelines
   - Stress importance of complete application
   - Board review timelines vary

2. **Intensive QA:**
   - Work with applicant daily to complete sections
   - Review in real-time as they fill out
   - Submit as soon as complete (don't wait)

3. **Communicate with management:**
   - After submission, send note: "This applicant has tight timeline due to [reason]. Please let me know if any issues immediately."
   - Monitor daily
   - Respond to RFIs within hours

**Pro Tip:** Your responsiveness directly impacts timeline. Be available and proactive.
